            The NAIF IDS required reading lists all default ID-name mappings
            for the SPICE toolkits and a description of functionality of the
            corresponding software.

         `The SPICE toolkit <http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html>`_
            NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) offers
            NASA flight projects and NASA funded researchers an observation
            geometry information system named "SPICE" to assist scientists in
            planning and interpreting scientific observations from space-based
            instruments aboard robotic planetary spacecraft. SPICE is also
            widely used in engineering tasks associated with these missions.
